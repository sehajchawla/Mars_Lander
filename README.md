# Mars Lander
In this project I simulated the landing of a rocket on mars. The project got really interesting when I programmed a autopilot function it as well.

Most of the project is in C++, but some parts of the simulation and plotting is done on Python.

The project was not only a demonstration of my skills in control theory, but it was also a great learning experience in simulations and modelling.
